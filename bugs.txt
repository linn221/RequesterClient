at /import-har, it is saying program_id is required. In import form, add a select input for program_id, there is GET /programs
on Request listing page, I do not want horizontal scroll and a table, but a Card layout, which should nicely fill all the information. and if the url is long, add see more link to view the full url. I don't want to use select box for choosing Endpoint in filter Requests, but to use text suggestion pop ups, also able to use the arrow keys and enter to choose.
on endpoint details page, show the related requests via /requests?endpoint_id=. use the same component as listing requests.
on program details page, show the related endpoints via /endpoints?program_id=. use the same component as listing endpoints.
When notes are displayed, add Edit button, use the PATCH method. I hope you are using one components for all view of listing notes, update the component, and also show the updated date as well.
on Request Details page, Headers should be displayed like "Server: Nginx", one line per header. You might have to parse the response, or not. Smartly use the openapi spec
