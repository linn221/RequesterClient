on Request listing page, show the filter box on start up, (do not call request listing API yet)
Filter by hash section should be small, insert a More button that expand and show all the hashes, but by default, show only small sets of hashes.
Makes Response Body modal's scroll bar bigger (currently, browser default scroll bar is overlapping. I want a simple big scroll bar that will scroll the Content of Response body)
Returns Text field for Request Listing, Endpoint Listing, and so on.

# Backend
Create Tags, and automatically set System tags like 'js','css','html' on Request when importing.
Add xml import from Burp Suite
Add domain filter in request listing page, includeSubdomains=1
Add url_contains=/api/RMSHandler, url_match=/api/RMSHandler


# Bugs
## Frontend
Go to Request detail page from the listing page filtered, then when going back to the listing page, the listing data are refresh without the filter, (ideally it should be at the previous position of previous listingp page)

# Later Features
Add Tags Under Hashes in Request Listing page
Encode/Decode base64
Image upload
Export current requests as PDF
Should be able to filter Notes by Selecting Program (multi select), Order By Date
Copy the Request as CURL

# Ideas
Analysing .css,.js,.html file line by line, and display the comments on new Comment section.
