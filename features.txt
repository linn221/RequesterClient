When displaying Notes (value of Note), if text contains a url, make it a hyperlink so that I can click and open in a new tab. Do it on other Description fields as well (Program, Endpoint, Requests, etc)
the updated spec has new fields for Request Listing response, show them in request listing page(eg, size, content_type). On Filter form, the api now supports multiple ordering via order_by1,order_by2, etc. I should be able to order by multiple types, and able to choose ascending or descending for each.
